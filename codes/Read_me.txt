1, training models: 
"Train_CNN-F.ipynb": train the CNN-F model. Note to change the path in the codes to match the data position. 
"Train_CNN-T.ipynb": train the CNN-T model. Note to change the path in the codes to match the data position. 
2, testing models:
(2.a) "Test_CNN-F_final.ipynb": 
(1) test the saved CNN-F model on different successive events;
(2) Change the data process (SP and NS) by choosing "model" to be 1 or 2;
(3) Change the type of testing datasets with different time intervals by "test_name" (choose from{  total,one_sec,two_sec, half_sec, one_half_sec } )
(4) Please change the path in the codes to match the data position before running it.
(2.b) "Test_CNN-T_final.ipynb":
(1) The (1-4) of (2.a) also apply here; 
3, "saved_models": this folder saves the trained models that reproduce our previous results. 
(1) ModelA: contains the saved CNN-F model; 
(2) ModelC: contains the saved CNN-T model.
