Code accompanying the paper ["Identifying-Overlapping-Successive-Events-Using-a-Shallow-Convolutional-Neural-Network"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8705309?casa_token=rbTOZ_5AZqUAAAAA:UiMo82yUQD6JJ_QU3TWLx6z5o8gHfCPEZpLWEMrMbePHUfXIJ2HOrJBrksitBmSrxK3_SDac)

## Prerequisites
The proposed method is implemented through Jupyter Notebook. The required packages include:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Tensorflow 1.80

## Getting started
1) You can run our trained model with "Test_CNN-F_final.ipynb", or train the model by yourself with "Train_CNN-F_final.ipynb".
